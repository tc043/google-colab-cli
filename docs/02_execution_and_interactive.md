2026-08-13: Made `colab console` resilient to long-lived proxy disconnects. Console now sends protocol ping/pong heartbeats, reports connection loss and retry progress, refreshes runtime-proxy credentials before reconnecting to the same endpoint, and reuses one stoppable stdin forwarding thread across attempts. Interactive sessions retry with 1/2/5/10/30-second backoff (then every 30 seconds); piped input is never replayed. Normal shell exits remain terminal, while an endpoint deletion or same-name replacement stops reconnecting safely. Added bounded loopback and resource-retention regressions after an unbounded zero-delay test loop caused pytest output capture to exhaust local memory.
2026-08-13: Fixed issue #106 for `exec`, `repl`, `console`, and `restart-kernel`: runtime startup proactively uses refreshed proxy credentials and retries one proxy-auth failure after a control-plane refresh. Terminal failures no longer unconditionally prune local state, and endpoint-guarded metadata cleanup prevents stale `finally` blocks from restoring expired tokens or reviving removed sessions.
2026-05-07: Fixed `colab console` piped-stdin handling. Previously a piped invocation (e.g. `echo 'cmd' | colab console -s s`) sent the command and then hung indefinitely because the previous EOF handler emitted a bare `\x04` (Ctrl-D), which the remote `tmux`-wrapped bash treats as a literal character rather than a session terminator. The new handler sends `exit\n` (which bash actually exits on) and then closes the websocket from the client side after a short grace period (`PIPED_EOF_GRACE_SECONDS = 0.5s`) so any tail output (bash `logout`, tmux `[exited]`) makes it back to the user. TTY mode is unchanged: real-terminal EOF is left to the remote shell. Verified live: `echo 'echo HELLO' | colab console -s s` now exits in ~1.2s instead of hanging.

2026-05-07: Fixed `print_kitty` (used by `colab exec --output-image` and any image-producing exec) to no-op when `sys.stdout.isatty()` is false. The Kitty Graphics Protocol escape sequence is meaningless when stdout is a file or pipe and was visually corrupting captured output (a multi-KB base64 PNG blob would land in log files, grep targets, or showboat captures). Image bytes are still saved to disk via `handle_image`'s file-write path; only the inline-render attempt is suppressed.

2026-06-04: Bumped the default `--timeout` for `colab exec` from 10s to 30s (and the matching `colab run` default) so brief silent tasks are less likely to hit a premature `TimeoutError`. Explicit `--timeout` overrides are unaffected.

# Design: Execution and Interactive Interaction (`repl`, `exec`, `console`)

## Overview
Execution involves sending Python code (or shell commands) to the Jupyter kernel running on the Colab VM and processing the stream of output messages.

## Approach

### 1. REPL (`colab repl`)
- **Transport**: WebSockets (using `websockets` library if allowed, or a custom `http.client` based long-polling implementation if we're strictly stdlib).
- **Communication**: Jupyter Kernel Messaging Protocol.
    - `execute_request`: Send code string.
    - `execute_reply`: Get status.
    - `iopub.stream`: Capture `stdout` and `stderr`.
- **Interactive Mode**: Standard Python `cmd.Cmd` or `code.InteractiveConsole` for local input/output.
- **Piping Support**: Detect `sys.stdin.isatty()`. If not a TTY, read all input and send as a single execution request.

### 2. Execution (`colab exec`)
- **File Handling**:
    - If file path is local: Read content, send as code.
    - If file path is remote: Execute `!python <path>`.
- **Multi-Modal Output**: Handle `display_data` messages (e.g., `image/png`, `text/html`). For the CLI, we'll save images to temporary files and print their paths, or if the terminal supports it (e.g., iTerm2), inline them.
- **Timeout Configuration**: Exposes a `--timeout` flag (default 30s) to allow long-running silent tasks (like model compilation or data downloading) to execute without being prematurely killed.

### 3. Console (`colab console`)
- **Implementation**: Connects directly to the backend terminal endpoint (`/colab/tty`) via WebSockets using `websocket-client`.
- **Interactive**: Bypasses the Jupyter kernel entirely to provide a raw, PTY-backed bash session on the Colab VM.
- **Terminal Management**: Configures `sys.stdin` to raw mode using `termios` and `tty`, passing single characters to the socket and writing raw ANSI escape sequences directly to `sys.stdout.buffer`. Hooks into `SIGWINCH` to communicate local terminal dimensions (`cols`/`rows`) to the remote bash environment so output rendering works perfectly during resizing.
- **Liveness detection**: `websocket-client` sends a protocol ping every 20 seconds and requires a pong within 10 seconds. This both keeps an otherwise-idle proxy path active and turns a silently dead path into a detectable disconnect.
- **Interactive reconnects**: An abnormal close after a successful handshake is reported on stderr, then retried after 1, 2, 5, 10, and 30 seconds, followed by 30-second retries until the user presses Ctrl-C or the assignment is confirmed gone. Each retry refreshes the assignment's runtime-proxy URL/token and accepts it only when it still belongs to the original endpoint; a same-name replacement is never entered. One stdin-forwarding thread is reused across every attempt and is stopped when Console exits, so reconnects cannot accumulate competing terminal readers.
- **Close semantics**: Close codes 1000 (normal) and 1001 (going away), plus a locally recognized `exit`, `logout`, or Ctrl-D request, end Console without reconnecting. A 401/404 initial-handshake error is returned to the shared one-time credential-refresh path rather than entering the unbounded transport reconnect loop.
- **Status visibility**: Connection loss, every retry delay/attempt, successful reconnection, and final closure are printed as concise `[colab]` messages on stderr, separate from the remote terminal byte stream.
- **Piped stdin**: Detected via `sys.stdin.isatty()`. When piped, the input characters are forwarded one at a time to the remote pty, and on EOF the client sends `exit\n` and then closes the websocket itself after `PIPED_EOF_GRACE_SECONDS` (0.5s) so the user's shell goodbye text drains back. The remote `/colab/tty` endpoint wraps bash in tmux, which intercepts a bare `\x04` as a literal character — that is why we send `exit\n` rather than Ctrl-D.
- **Piped disconnects**: Piped input is never reconnected or replayed because the CLI cannot know which bytes the remote shell already consumed. An abnormal close returns a non-zero exit with a concise error instead.

### 4. Expired Runtime-Proxy Credentials

- Session resolution adopts the latest runtime-proxy token and URL returned by `/tun/m/assignments` before Jupyter or terminal connection startup.
- A proxy-auth 401/404 triggers one refresh-and-retry. A repeated failure is reported without deleting the local binding unless the assignments endpoint independently confirms the VM endpoint is gone.
- Kernel/session ID callbacks and `running`/`last_execution` cleanup use endpoint-guarded field updates, so a stale command cannot overwrite a token refreshed by another invocation or recreate a deleted session. This specifically prevents the former Console `finally` resurrection path.

## Implementation Details
- **Kernel Management**: `ColabRuntime` (from `colab-agent`) already handles message signing and message types.
- **Output Streaming**: Continuous polling or asynchronous message handling to provide real-time output.
- **Piping Example**: `cat script.py | colab exec -s my-session`.

## Testing Strategy
TDD is mandatory for all execution features.

### 1. Mock Kernel Client
- **Test Case**: Verify `ColabRuntime` correctly sends an `execute_request` message over the websocket.
- **Test Case**: Verify `iopub.stream` messages are correctly handled and printed to `stdout` in real-time.
- **Test Case**: Verify `display_data` (specifically `image/png`) triggers the correct local handling (saving or display).

### 2. TTY and Piping
- **Test Case**: Mock `sys.stdin.isatty()` to verify `colab repl` correctly switches between interactive mode and one-shot piped execution.
- **Test Case**: Verify large piped inputs are handled without buffer overflow or truncation.
- **Test Case**: `colab console` with piped stdin sends `exit\n` and calls `ws.close()` on EOF (regression: previously sent `\x04` only and hung).
- **Test Case**: `colab console` in TTY mode does not synthesize an exit on EOF (the user owns the session lifecycle).
- **Test Case**: An abnormal interactive close prints visible state changes, refreshes credentials for the same endpoint, and reconnects using one stdin reader; deletion and same-name endpoint replacement stop retries.
- **Test Case**: Protocol ping/pong settings are enabled, normal closes do not reconnect, and initial 401/404 handshake failures return to the bounded shared token-refresh path.
- **Test Case**: A real loopback WebSocket closes once abnormally and then normally, proving that the refreshed token is used on the second handshake. The fake peer has a hard timeout and propagates server-thread exceptions. `integration/repro_console_reconnect/test.sh` repeats the fault injection against an isolated live CPU assignment, checks the visible status sequence and remote marker, removes only its recorded endpoint, and verifies the pre-existing endpoint snapshot is unchanged.
- **Test Case**: Test-only reconnect limits prevent zero-delay retry fixtures from spinning forever. A 500-attempt object-retention regression verifies that old WebSocket attempts are collectable, and an idle-stdin regression verifies that the forwarding thread stops without waiting for another keystroke.
- **Test Case**: Piped disconnects fail once without retrying or replaying input.
- **Test Case**: `print_kitty` is a no-op when `sys.stdout.isatty()` is false (regression: previously emitted ANSI/base64 into pipes and files).
- **Test Case**: Runtime-proxy 401/404 startup failures refresh and retry once without unconditional pruning.
- **Test Case**: Console and execution cleanup merge metadata into the latest endpoint-matching state and never revive a removed session.
